## Introduction
This project aims to create a PDF chat application using Next.js, Langchain, and Pinecone. The application allows users to upload a PDF document and engage in a conversation with the content of the document.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies.
3. **Environment Variables:** Set up environment variables for Pinecone and other configurations as per the provided .env.example.
4. **Start the Application:** Run npm run dev to start the development server.

## Methodology
1. **Document Processing:** The application uses Langchain to process the uploaded PDF document. Langchain is a library for natural language processing tasks.
2. **Embedding Creation:** Langchain is employed to create embeddings for the text extracted from the PDF document. Embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.
3. **Pinecone Indexing:** Pinecone is used as a vector store to index the embeddings. Pinecone allows fast and efficient similarity search on high-dimensional vectors.
4. **Chat Interface:** Users can interact with the content of the PDF document using a chat interface powered by Next.js.

## Technical Stacks
* **Next.js:** Next.js is a React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
* **Langchain:** Langchain provides tools and utilities for natural language processing tasks such as text splitting and embeddings.
* **Pinecone:** Pinecone is a cloud-native vector database optimized for similarity search and real-time analytics.
* **TypeScript:** TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer experience.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Pinecone Database Setup:** Setting up Pinecone and understanding its API for indexing and querying vectors posed a challenge due to its unique architecture and features.
2. **Embedding Creation:** Generating embeddings for large text documents efficiently required careful consideration of resource usage and performance optimization.

## Key Learnings
1. **Pinecone Integration:** Working with Pinecone provided insights into efficient vector indexing and similarity search techniques.
2. **Text Embeddings:** Understanding text embeddings and their applications in natural language processing tasks like document similarity and question answering.
3. **Next.js Development:** Developing with Next.js for server-side rendering and client-side interactivity improved understanding of modern web application development practices.

## Conclusion
The PDF chat application showcases the integration of Next.js, Langchain, and Pinecone to create a novel way of interacting with document content. The project not only provides a functional application but also serves as a learning experience in modern web development and natural language processing technologies.
